# Sudoku-Solver
This project demonstrates a Java-based solution for solving Sudoku puzzles using recursion and backtracking. The class, SudokuSolver, is designed to handle any standard 9x9 Sudoku grid and find a valid solution by 
filling in the empty cells. The algorithm works by placing numbers sequentially in each empty cell while adhering to Sudoku's basic rulesâ€”ensuring no number repeats in any row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid. If a conflict 
arises, the backtracking mechanism allows the algorithm to retrace steps, exploring alternative possibilities until a valid configuration is found. This project highlights the power of recursive problem-solving.
